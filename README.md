This repository provides a comprehensive benchmark of prominent multi-document abstractive summarization models. It includes the implementation, fine-tuning, and evaluation of ten distinct approaches on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Each model is rigorously benchmarked using ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics to enable a fair, head-to-head comparison. The codebase is designed for clarity, extensibility, and full reproducibility.

2. Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the benchmark.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.9+

PyTorch

CUDA 11+ enabled GPU (recommended for neural models)

Quick Start:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/summarization-benchmark.git
cd summarization-benchmark

Install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Place the dataset (if using local CSVs) in the /data directory.

Run the benchmark: Open and execute the cells in notebook.ipynb for the complete end-to-end workflow, including training, inference, and evaluation.

3. Models Implemented
This project benchmarks a diverse set of models, from state-of-the-art transformers to classical graph-based methods. Models without public weights are approximated using robust, open-source proxies, which are clearly noted.

4. Dataset Preparation
The primary dataset is CNN/Daily Mail, loaded directly from Hugging Face datasets or local CSV files located in the /data/ directory.

Preprocessing steps include uniform whitespace normalization, basic text cleaning, and model-specific formatting (e.g., adding a "summarize: " prefix for T5).

The number of examples and batch sizes are configurable within the main notebook.

5. Training & Inference
Supervised Models (BART, PEGASUS, T5): These are loaded from Hugging Face Transformers. The provided pipeline supports both fine-tuning (a single epoch by default) and pure inference on the test set.

Unsupervised & Graph-based Models: These are implemented using libraries like NLTK and scikit-learn to perform extractive summarization (e.g., Lead-3, sentence graph ranking).

All models are run on the same test data subset to ensure a fair and direct comparison.

6. Evaluation
All models are evaluated against the reference summaries from the CNN/Daily Mail test set using the following metrics:

ROUGE-1: Overlap of unigrams (individual words).

ROUGE-2: Overlap of bigrams (pairs of words).

ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence, which measures sentence-level structure similarity.

The final reported scores are the ROUGE F1-measures, averaged across all samples in the evaluation batch.

7. Results & Visualization
The following table summarizes the performance of each model on the test set.

8. Hyperparameters
To ensure reproducibility, the experiments are run with the following key hyperparameters:

Random Seed: 42

Batch Size: Configurable (defaults to 4)

Max Input Length: 512-4096 tokens (model-dependent)

Max Summary Length: 128 tokens

Beam Size (Decoding): 4

Device: GPU (if available), otherwise CPU

Learning Rate: 2e-5 (for fine-tuning transformers)

9. Issues Encountered & Workarounds
Unavailable Model Weights: For some research models (e.g., Absformer, TG-MultiSum), official weights are not public. These were approximated with robust algorithmic proxies (e.g., Lead-3, TextRank), which are clearly noted in the code and documentation.

Dependency Conflicts: Resolved by creating a stable requirements.txt file with tested library versions.

Library Issues: Fallback custom implementations were created for certain graph-based algorithms to avoid unstable third-party libraries.

10. How to Use / Run Each Model
Jupyter/Colab (notebook.ipynb): The recommended method. Execute cells in sequence to run the entire pipeline. The evaluation loop will automatically train, evaluate, and compare all configured models.

Python Script (scripts/run_all_models.py): For automated runs, modify the script to call each model by name, process data in batches, and collect results.
