Research Intern Assignment: Multi-Document Abstractive Summarization Benchmark
Overview
This repository implements, trains (where possible), and evaluates ten leading multi-document summarization models—both neural and classical—on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. Each model is evaluated with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, enabling a fair, head-to-head benchmark. The codebase is designed for clarity, extensibility, and full reproducibility.

2. Getting Started
Prerequisites:

Python 3.9+

CUDA 11+ GPU (recommended for neural models)

Download CNN/DailyMail from Hugging Face, Kaggle, or provided scripts (see data/)

Quick start:

Install all dependencies:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place dataset CSVs in the /data directory.

Open and run notebook.ipynb for training, inference, and full evaluation.

For script-based use:

text
python scripts/run_all_models.py
3. Models Implemented
#	Model	Type / Source
1	PRIMERA	(Documented, proxy only)
2	BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)	Neural, Hugging Face
3	PEGASUS (google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail)	Neural, Hugging Face
4	T5 (t5-base, t5-large)	Neural, Hugging Face
5	Longformer/BigBird/PEGASUS/LongT5	Neural, public proxy
6	Absformer	Unsupervised, Lead-3 proxy
7	Graph-based (e.g., TextRank/TG-MultiSum)	Extractive/graph
8	Hierarchical Transformer	Two-stage neural
9	Deep Communicating Agents (DCA)	Ensemble simulation
10	Topic-Guided (Keyword-aware)	Neural + external knowledge
Models without public weights (e.g., PRIMERA, TG-MultiSum) are approximated by robust open-source proxies and are clearly noted.

4. Dataset Preparation
The main notebook loads CNN/Daily Mail train/validation/test splits from Hugging Face Datasets or CSV files (in /data/).

Preprocessing:

Uniform whitespace and basic cleaning

Model-specific formatting (T5: prompt prefix, PRIMERA: doc-sep tokens)

Batch size and number of examples are configurable.

5. Training & Inference
Supervised transformer models (BART, PEGASUS, T5, etc.) are loaded using Hugging Face Transformers. The provided pipeline allows for single-epoch training/fine-tuning or pure inference.

Unsupervised and graph-based models use NLTK, scikit-learn, and classic algorithms for extractive summarization (e.g., Lead-3, sentence graph ranking).

All inference is run on the same data subset for a fair benchmark.

6. Evaluation
All models generate summaries for a test batch, which are then compared to ONN reference summaries using:

ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap)

ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap)

ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence)

The ROUGE F1 scores are reported as mean across samples.

7. Results & Visualization

Visualization
Bar plot generation code is provided in the notebook and scripts for publication-quality model comparison.
Customize plot colors and scaling for presentations.

8. Hyperparameters
Random seed: 42 (for reproducibility)

Batch size: Configurable; see notebook/script

Max input length: 512–4096 (model-dependent)

Max summary length: 128–160 tokens typical

Beam size: 4 (neural model decoding)

Device: GPU (if available), else CPU

Learning rate: 2e-5 (default for transformers)

9. Issues Encountered & Workarounds
Unavailable research model weights: Used sound algorithmic proxies, clearly noted in code and this documentation.

Dependency conflicts: Fixed with strict pip versioning; see the requirements file.

TextRank/gensim library issues: Provided fallback custom graph-based extractive implementation using NLTK and scikit-learn.

Weight/tokenizer warnings: Noted; additional fine-tuning is recommended for best competition results.

10. How to Use / Run Each Model
Jupyter/Colab:

Execute cells in sequence for data prep, training/inference, evaluation, and reporting.

Evaluate and compare all models by running the evaluation loop or using the provided function wrappers.

Python script:

Modify the scripts/run_all_models.py or similar to call each model by name, batch process, and collect results.

Custom model/fine-tuning:

Adjust hyperparameters and the DataPreprocessor class to support new models or datasets.
